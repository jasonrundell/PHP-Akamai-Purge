    I came across https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=43910 while doing a Google search for
    other folks who have worked with Akamai's SOAP API and PHP. The original function
    pap_purge() function was started from the code hradtke@php.net provided publicly.

	to thank! How many hradtke could there be, right? :)

Server requirements:
